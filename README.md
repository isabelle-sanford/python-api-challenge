This is a two-part project made as part of the USC Viterbi Data Boot Camp (API module). 

Part 1: WeatherPy
This is a jupyter notebook which gathers weather data from 500 randomly located cities, and analyzes resulting trends by latitude. It uses the OpenWeather API, and requires the API key to be stored as "weather_api_key" in file "api_keys". 
It uses modules: pandas, pyplot from matplotlib, citipy, stats from scipy, and random. 

The weather data is made into a csv, and all graphs are exported as .pngs (all to the same folder in which WeatherPy is stored). 

Conclusions: temperature correlates strongly with latitude, with locations near the equator having on average much higher temperatures than those near the poles. Latitude does not appear to correlate strongly with cloudiness, wind speed, or humidity. 

Part 2: VacationPy

Using the csv generated by part 1, this notebook filters down the cities to around 10 in ideal conditions: 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit, less than 50% humidity, between 2 and 8 mph winds, and 0% cloudiness. Then the gmaps module is used (again, requires the API key stored in "api_keys" as "g_key") to find the nearest hotel to those locations, and plotted over a humidity heat map.
